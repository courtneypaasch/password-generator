# Password Generator

In this assignment, I was asked to create an application that would allow users to generate a randomized password based on their personalized criteria. Users select their password length (between 8 and 128 characters) as well as if they would like to include special characters, numbers, capital letters, and/or lowercase letters. 

This process is important as the best way to create a strong and secure password is to randomize it. The user-selected inclusions also allow the application to generate passwords for use regardless of external stipulations.
